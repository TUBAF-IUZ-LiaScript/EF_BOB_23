> Aliens created Robots to exterminate humanity. They fled to the Moon and created androids to recapture Earth. Most Attempts to create a foothold on Earth have failed and for thousends of years the world has been locked in a perpetual stalemate between the androids and the robots. Now, in the year 11945 a new division of androids called YoRha was created to finally break the robot resistents. A limited amount about the actuall inner workings of the androids and robots is given.
